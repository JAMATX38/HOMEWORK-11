# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## MY TASK

Create a Note Taker application that can be used to take and store notes. This application will use Express.js on the back end and retrive Note Data from a JSON file.

Front end started code has already been given, my task is to build the back end.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
## Installation

You will need to install the package json file.

This prgram uses nodemon so when you start the server syntax is nodemon server.js

## Technologies Used

Express.js
JavaScript
Heroku to deploy

## Known Bugs

Cannot get the notes to save to the JSOON file. I planned to work on this more but didnt get to come back to this. I need to get missing Homeworks turned in because end of class is fast approaching.
